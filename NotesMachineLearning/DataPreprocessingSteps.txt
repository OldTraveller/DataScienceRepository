Preprocessing the Data
---------------------------------------------------------
In our daily life we deal with lots of data. 
To process the data, we need to convert it from the
raw form to the form in which it can be fed as an input to some machine Learning Algorithm. 
In simple form, we say that we ned to carry out some processing on the data before sending it
for some operation on Machine Learning stuff. 
This is called Preprocessing of the Data. 

---------------------------------------------------------
How to do Preprocessing ??
---------------------------------------------------------
1) Import all the necessary packages. If we are using Python then this is the first
step to Preprocess the data. 
import the necessary packages to get the suitable libraries and functions and all teh kind of 
stuff out there. 

import numpy as np 
import sklearn.preprocessing 



NumPy − Basically NumPy is a general purpose array-processing package designed to 
efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary records without 
sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional arrays.

Sklearn.preprocessing − This package provides many common utility functions and 
transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is 
more suitable for machine learning algorithms.
