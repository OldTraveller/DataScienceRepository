Most common Machine Learning Algorithms:

1) Linear Regression 
We say that one variable input variable can be used to compute an output variable 
y. 
Types of Linear Regression:- 
a) Multiple Linear Regression
b) Single Linear Regression 

Linear Regression is mainly used to compute a single value based on something. 

Logistic Regression :- Predicts the probability of something. It has all the possible values 
between 0 and 1. 

Decision Trees:
is a Supervised Learning Algorithm that is mostly used for the classification problems. 
Decision Trees have a root node and exhibit a tree like structure. 
And the leaves there are known as the Decision leaves. 

SVM (Support Vector Machines) 
It is mainly used for classification problems. 

Naive Bayes 
It is also classification technique for the stuff. 
The logic behind this classification technique is to use the Naive Bayesian Classifiers. 
It assumes that the presence of a particular feature is independent of the presence of other 
feature. 

K nearest neighbour
1) Picks up k nearest clusters for the data provided.
2) find the centroid of all the clusters among the k clusters. 

Random Forest
It is a Supervised Learning Algorithm
It is a combination of descision trees. This is also known as forest. 
Then the algorithm selects teh best classifications from the available classifiaction done
by descision trees.
